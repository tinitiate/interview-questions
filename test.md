# Java Object Oriented Programming Interview Questions

## Object Oriented Programming
---

#### What is Object Oriented Programming?
> Its a concept of programming, where all functionality is handled as an Object
> (instance of a Class). The Class is a collection of Fields(Attributes) and 
> Methods.

#### What are the major features of Object Oriented Programming ?
> Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism.

#### What is Abstraction?
> Abstraction is a feature of a Class in Object Oriented Programming, where 
> the class has public and private fields and methods, The Public Fields and 
> methods are the ones that are exposed to other classes, And the private ones 
> are hidden, of internal class usage only.

#### What is Encapsulation?
> Encapsulation is the process of combining fields(data) and methods(functions)
> into a single unit called class. usually the Fields and methods are co-related
> by a purpose.
> Abstraction and encapsulation are complementary by nature,
> Abstraction focuses on access to Fields and Methods
> Encapsulation focuses on the implementation of the Class.

#### What is Inheritance?
> Inheritance is a feature of Object Oriented Programming, which enables a 
> Parent Class methods and fields (collectively called as members) to be
> accessed by Child class.

#### What is composition?
> Composition is the object-oriented programming feature, where an object 
> contains a 'call' to another class object.

#### What is Polymorphism?
>

#### Class
>

#### Objects
>

#### Objects properties
>

#### Objects Compare, Copy
